To solve bandit10 you must use the grep command to find a plaintext string next to multiple =. To do so you can use the command 'grep -n -a '==' data.txt'. If you do not include the -a flag then it will only return 'grep: data.txt: binary file matches' and not display any information. By using -a we will get the 'after context' and we can specify how many lines we would like. Using the -n just tells us that the password is on line 64. After 10 equals signs I found the password to be 'FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey'.
