To complete bandit14 you must extract the ssh key from their server and use it to log in to the next level. To do so you find the key in the sshkey.private file right in the home directory. You can then use the scp command to securly copy it back to your machine with 'scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:sshkey.private ./cs-comps/bandit'. Then you have the key on your machine, however, if you try to use it you will get the error 'UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE' which will cause the log in to fail. You can change the permissions with the commnad 'chmod 700 cs-comps/bandit/sshkey.private'. Then you can log in to bandit14 with the command 'ssh -p 2220 -i ./cs-comps/bandit/sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org'

*Note I found the password to bandit14 in the next level to be 'MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS'
