To complete bandit12 you must unscramble a rot13 cypher. To do so you can use the command tr to change the characters in the string. To solve the rot13 cypher we want to rotate all characters, both upper and lower case, by 13 places in their respecive case. We can acomplish this by using the command 'cat data.txt | tr  'a-zA-Z' 'n-za-mN-ZA-M''. This command takes all the letters from 'a-z' and replaces the first thirteen with 'n-z' and the second 13 with 'a-m'. It then does the same with the uppercase letters. This revealed the password to be '7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4'.
