To solve bandit13 you must reverse a hex dump and uncompress a file. To do so you start by reversing the hex dump with the command 'xxd -r data.txt > compressed_data.gz' we know it is a .gz file because the signature of the hex dump matches gzip compression. I used this website https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19120676/how-to-detect-type-of-compression-used-on-the-file-if-no-file-extension-is-spe to determine the hexdump compression header formats. Then using 'gzip -d compressed_data.gz' we can uncompress it. Then I can use the command 'xxd compressed_data' to see the hex dump so I can figure out this has been compressed with bzip2. I then have to alter the file extension with 'mv compressed_data compressed_data.bz2'. Finally I can uncompress it with 'bunzip compressed_data.bz2'. Again using xxd I can see it is compressed using gzip so I can rename it then use 'gzip -d compressed_data.gz'. If we then look at the data we can see a filename which suggests that this data is not compressed but archived. We can extract this archive with 'tar -xvf compressed_data.tar'. This gives us the file 'data5.bin' which when we examine it seems to be another archive. After running 'tar -xvf data5.bin' we get the file data6.bin which when examined is another bzip2 file. After running 'bunzip2 data6.bin' and examining the output file we can see it is another tar archive. Then I ran 'tar -xvf data6.bin.out' to get the file data8.bin which is a gzip file. After renaming the file and running 'gzip -d data8.gz' I finally found that the password is 'FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn'.
