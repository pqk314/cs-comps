To complete bandit5 we needed to see the list of files in 'inhere'. Then we can find which file is human readable by using the file command to determine the type of data in each file. This is a little tricky since the files start with '-', but to allow us to see them and still look at every file we can use the command 'file ./*' which tells us that '-file07' is the only one that contains ASCII text. Then we can cat the file to see that the password is '4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw'.
