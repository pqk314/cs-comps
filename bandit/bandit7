To complete bandit7 you must use the find command with the args to find the correct file metadata and to surpress the error messages that occur when using the find command. By using 'find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c -type f 2>/dev/null' I was able to find that the password is 'morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj'.
